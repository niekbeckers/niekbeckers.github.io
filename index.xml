We made a video explaining JOAN in more detail:

      <description>Hi!
I am an engineer and researcher interested in human-robot interaction. I enjoy understanding the complex interactions between humans and robots, making computational models of human behavior, and developing robots that can work in synergy with humans. This requires a multidisciplinary toolkit, which I try to apply and strengthen every day, ranging from robotics and machine learning to human factors research. To support my research I built my own robots and software (check out my projects).</description>

      <description>During my PhD I studied and modeled how two people perform a task together through physical interaction: by interacting through forces for which I used a robot setup. Together with Koen from Hankamp Rehab, we designed and built our own robotic setup to perform my experiments. The setup consists of two identical high-performance planar robots, controlled by a real-time operating system (through EtherCAT and TwinCAT). We did multiple experiments on them, with over 140 participants and multiple Master theses ðŸ˜ƒ.</description>
