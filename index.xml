      <description>The Human-Robot Interaction group of Cognitive Robotics at TU Delft does a lot of research on interactions between humans and automated vehicles (drivers interacting with their automated car, but also with pedestrians and other road users). We developed a high-fidelity and customizable virtual reality driving simulator that makes performing experiments as easy and repeatable as possible.
At the core of our virtual driving simulator is CARLA, a driving simulator based on the Unreal game engine developed for autonomous vehicle-related research.</description>

      <description>Hi!
I am an engineer and researcher interested in human-robot interaction. I enjoy understanding the complex interactions between humans and robots, making computational models of human behavior, and developing robots that can work in synergy with humans. This requires a multidisciplinary toolkit, which I try to apply and strengthen every day, ranging from robotics and machine learning to human factors research. To support my research I built my own robots and software (check out my projects).</description>

      <description>During my PhD I studied and modeled how two people perform a task together through physical interaction: by interacting through forces. We were interested in studying human-human interaction to develop better controllers for physical rehabilitation robots. Because we did not have a ready-made robot solution to research physical human-human interaction, we (Koen from Hankamp Rehab and I) designed and built our own robotic setup from scratch. The robot setup consists of two identical high-performance robots.</description>
