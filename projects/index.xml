      <description>The Human-Robot Interaction group of Cognitive Robotics at TU Delft does a lot of research on interactions between humans and automated vehicles (drivers, but also pedestrians and other road users). In order to facilitate this research, we need a high-fidelity and customizable virtual reality driving simulator.
At the core of our virtual driving simulator is CARLA, a driving simulator based on the Unreal gaming engine developed for autonomous vehicle-related research CARLA has been developed to support the development, training, and validation of autonomous vehicles, and contains a massive toolset for machine learning applications.</description>

      <description>During my PhD I studied and modeled how two people perform a task together through physical interaction: by interacting through forces for which I used a robot setup. Together with Koen from Hankamp Rehab, we designed and built our own robotic setup to perform my experiments. The setup consists of two identical high-performance planar robots, controlled by a real-time operating system (through EtherCAT and TwinCAT). We did multiple experiments on them, with over 140 participants and multiple Master theses ðŸ˜ƒ.</description>
